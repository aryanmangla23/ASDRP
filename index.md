### Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenera- tive disease among the elderly population. Currently, the sci- entific community accepts the amyloid hypothesis, which states that the accumulation of Aβ peptides is the principal cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Improper APP cleavage is a major con- tributor to AD as it leads to the misfolding of the extracellular Aβ peptides and tau proteins, which leads to memory loss and increasing disorientation. Our study investigates the effect of Aβ aggregation on short term associative memory (STAM) in C. elegans. We predict that transgenic C. elegans with neuronal Aβ peptide aggregation will have decreased STAM in comparison to the N2 Wild Type and CL2122 control strains. Each strain of C. elegans was conditioned to associate food with butanone, and this association was tested via chemotaxis assay and compared with baseline chemotaxis indices to assess the effects of Aβ ag- gregation on short term memory loss. Our results show that the pattern of deterioration of the Cl2122 strain is similar to that of N2 Wild Type. The CL2355 strain suffered the most detrimen- tal loss of STAM. This indicates that Aβ aggregation negatively affects short term associative memory in C. elegans. However, these results could be due to stress from handling, implying that the coupling of Aβ was a contributing factor to the decline in STAM in the CL2355 strain. Overall, our study has shown that Aβ aggregation impairs associative mechanisms in C. elegans.
